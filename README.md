# **BIOMIMETICS in Bio-Inspired Robot Teams (BIRT)**

This repository contains the implementation of the **BIOMIMETICS** section from the research paper titled *"Toward Human Interaction with Bio-Inspired Teams"*, presented at the 10th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2011). The focus of this implementation is on exploring human interaction with bio-inspired robot teams (BIRT) in a foraging task using biomimetic models.

## Overview

In the context of bio-inspired teams, biomimetics refers to modeling agents' behaviors based on biological principles observed in nature, such as the behavior of fish schools. This implementation simulates two biomimetic management strategies for a foraging task:

- **Parameter-Based Management (PAR)**
- **Predator-Based Management (PRED)**
